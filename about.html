    <h1>How I did start this project</h1>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Johndoe0153/monte-cristo-theme/master/Count%20in%20the%20README.jpg">
    <h3>In middle of October 2021, I started learn html, css and js.</h3>
    <div class="about-monte-cristo">
        <p>So I installed VScode on my laptop and looked for a dark theme for it. Then I chose the Dracula theme. And I really liked it.</p>
        <p>
            I really like the concept of dracula theme.
            Because its name, Dracula, and its color go really well together.
            But I didn't like the color itself a little bit.  Because the color wasn't that vivid.
            So, I decided make my own color schemes as zenorocha did!
            For this, I sought inspiration from many sources. Such as include firefox, material design's color.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>At last,  October 24, 2021</strong> I made my own color scheme. And I named it "Monte Cristo".
            It inspired from a novel "The Count of Monte Cristo" which written by France author, Alexandre Dumas.
            It is one of my favorite novel. At first time, I wanted to name it the full name of the novel... But it was quite too long.
            So I named it as <strong>"Monte Cristo"</strong>
            <strong>Oct 29, 2021</strong> - My first commit was Notepad++. And I keep make theme for many apps such as Windows Terminal and Firefox.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you liked this theme. And enjoy your works with <strong>The Count of Dark Theme - Monte Cristo</strong> :D
